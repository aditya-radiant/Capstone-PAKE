# PAKE? What is that?
**PAKE** (Pemeliharaan Kendaraan), is an application that can list your car, and also remind you about your car maintenance time
People sometimes didnt treat car maintenance seriously, sometimes they forgot to schedule maintenance to their car, it sometimes proven to be dangerous, it can lead to uncomfortable driving, even can lead to traffic accident.
To tackle this, we plan to create an app that will track your cars maintenance time like when to change the oil, when to check your engine, etc. To determine that, the user needs to input their cars usage (Low, Medium, High) and their cars mileage to judge the maintenance time, 
Low usage means longer time between repair, and shorter time between repair to High Usage, for now it sort of measure the time with usage, but in time we can add like when someone wants to go to a trip, then the apps can recommend what parts need maintenance, and also we can add more vehicle, like motorbike, or truck.
